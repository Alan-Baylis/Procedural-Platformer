you can try it here: https://josephcarrington.github.io/Procedural-Platformer/
if it looks like crap or makes you dizzy, try the fullscreen button. I'm still working on the camera settings for different screen resolutions

### Controls

Jump around a procedurally generated platformer without dying from falling.Collect coins for some reason. More features incoming
(A D,LEFT RIGHT, PS4 Left Stick) to move about
(Space, PS4 X) to jump
W to use a jump boost thingy
R to reset
Tab to make the minimap bigger

Based on the ideas from here: http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AAdonaac/20150903/252889/Procedural_Dungeon_Generation_Algorithm.php
